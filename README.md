# imap-server

An IMAP server in node.js

This project is a work in progress and is just starting.  The long term goal is to implement [RFC3501](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501]) in all its glory.

## Prior Art

There are many implementations in other high level languages on GitHub, mostly incomplete.  Porting one of these will likely yield the best initial results.
